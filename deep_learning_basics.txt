Deep Learning Fundamentals

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

Neural Network Architecture:
- Input Layer: Receives the raw data
- Hidden Layers: Process and transform the data
- Output Layer: Produces the final prediction
- Activation Functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh
- Backpropagation: Algorithm for training networks

Key Concepts:
- Gradient Descent: Optimization algorithm
- Loss Functions: Measure prediction errors
- Regularization: Prevent overfitting
- Batch Normalization: Stabilize training
- Dropout: Reduce overfitting

Types of Neural Networks:
- Feedforward Networks: Basic architecture
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): For sequential data
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Advanced RNN variant

Deep Reinforcement Learning:
Combines deep learning with reinforcement learning to handle complex state spaces. Uses neural networks to approximate value functions or policies.

Popular Algorithms:
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Actor-Critic Methods
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Prerequisites:
- Linear algebra and calculus
